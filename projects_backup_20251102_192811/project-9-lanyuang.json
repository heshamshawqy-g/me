            "Parametric Weaving System of the Double-Skin Façade: The design of the North site employs a parametric weaving system for its double-skin facade, inspired by the intricate layering found in Chinese architectural ornamentation and lantern craftsmanship. This system weaves metal and glass elements in dynamic patterns that respond to environmental and visual needs, allowing light and shadow to interact throughout the day. The facade not only pays homage to traditional craftsmanship but also enhances natural ventilation, shading, and energy efficiency, blending cultural heritage with contemporary sustainable design",
            "Canopy Geometry Optimization Based on Environmental Performance: The canopy geometry was developed through advanced environmental performance simulations, optimizing its form to respond to local climatic conditions such as Hunan’s humidity, mist, and diffuse light. By integrating daylight and airflow analyses, the structure provides comfortable microclimates beneath while visually connecting the modern and traditional zones of the LanYuan project. The gradual shift in canopy form mirrors the site’s architectural transition, from clean, modern geometry in the south to the soft, red-hued elegance near the temple in the north.",
            "Design Development and Drawings Automation: To support the project’s complexity, automated design development and drawing systems were implemented using computational design tools. These systems streamline the generation of construction details, facade layouts, and fabrication data, ensuring precision and adaptability throughout the design process. Automation enables rapid iterations, maintaining coherence across the project’s evolving architectural language while preserving the poetic dialogue between technology and tradition that defines the LanYuan site."
