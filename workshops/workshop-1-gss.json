            "As part of the IAAC Global Summer School 2024, I co-led a workshop titled “Advanced Computation for Design” in collaboration with James McBennett from IAAC. The workshop introduced participants to advanced computational design techniques, focusing on mathematically driven surfaces, machine learning, and environmental analysis in architecture. The sessions combined theoretical foundations with hands-on exercises using Python, Rhino, and Grasshopper, empowering participants to integrate algorithmic thinking into architectural workflows.",
            "Over three intensive days, participants explored a range of topics, including creating mathematical surfaces, tessellating complex geometries, decoding panel systems, and applying clustering algorithms such as K-Means and DBScan. They learned to rationalize geometry, optimize designs, and analyze architectural attributes with precision. The curriculum also introduced machine learning concepts tailored for architecture, guiding participants through data preparation, model training, and predictive analysis to enhance design decision-making.",
